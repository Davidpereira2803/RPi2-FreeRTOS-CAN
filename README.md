# Introduction

This repository is a fork of a FreeRTOS version for Raspberry Pi 2. The Default Demo includes a function to make external LED's blink, with a task on FREERTOS. The Makefile is adapted to allow C library to work on FreeRTOS, ideally libraries that allow C to write and read .txt files.
